# SPO
Smart "Prediction, and then Optimize"

Adam's Paper

Most machine learning tools are intended to minimize prediction error and do not account for how the predictions
will be used in the downstream optimization problem. 
In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart “Predict, then Optimize” (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization problem structure.
